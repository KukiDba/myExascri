Steps to change flashcache mode from writethrough to writaback:
---------------------------------------------------------------
It can be done in rolling as well non-rolling fashion. For rolling fashion we have to perform below

Steps in each cell server one by one.
-------------------------------------

Step 1. Drop the flash cache on that cell
#cellcli –e drop flashcache

Step 2. Check the status of ASM if the grid disks go OFFLINE. The following command should return 'Yes' for the grid disks being listed
# cellcli -e list griddisk attributes name,asmmodestatus,asmdeactivationoutcome

Step 3. Inactivate the griddisk on the cell
# cellcli –e alter griddisk all inactive

Step 4. Shut down cellsrv service
# cellcli -e alter cell shutdown services cellsrv

Step 5. Set the cell flashcache mode to writeback
# cellcli -e "alter cell flashCacheMode=writeback"

Step 6. Restart the cellsrv service
# cellcli -e alter cell startup services cellsrv

Step 7. Reactivate the griddisks on the cell
# cellcli –e alter griddisk all active

Step 8. Verify all grid disks have been successfully put online 
using the following command:
# cellcli -e list griddisk attributes name, asmmodestatus

Step 9. Recreate the flash cache
# cellcli -e create flashcache all

Step 10. Check the status of the cell to confirm that it's now in WriteBack mode
# cellcli -e list cell detail | grep flashCacheMode

Step 11. Repeat these same steps again on the next cell to the FINAL cell. However, before taking another storage server offline, execute the following making sure 'asmdeactivationoutcome' displays YES

# cellcli -e list griddisk attributes name,asmmodestatus,asmdeactivationoutcome



The flashCacheMode attribute is used to display and set the current value for flash
cache. The values are writethrough (the default) or writeback. Note the following
about the flashCacheMode attribute:
– If the attribute is modified from writeback to writethrough and there is
existing flash cache, then an error is displayed. The flash cache must be
flushed and dropped before changing the attribute to writethrough.
– If the attribute is to be modified from writethrough to writeback, then flash
cache must be dropped before modifying the attribute.
– Write back caching can be disabled on the grid disks that do not need caching,
such as the grid disks in the RECO disk group. This allows other objects to use
the cache space.
